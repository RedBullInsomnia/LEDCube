# LEDCube
This repository contains most of the work our team of 4 did in order to complete a LED cube as part of a university project.

It contains :
- the footprints of the circuit board used to control the leds.
- the C code for the PIC that generated the patterns, placed on the control board.
- the C code for the PIC that controlled the dc/dc converter whose design is not included in this repository. This part can easily be replaced by a commercial dc/dc converter.
